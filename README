Using the framework that we discussed in class, I was able to build up a translater that does an okay job of translating from lambda to pythonic lambdas. However, I am running into issues of parentheses beign in the wrong place for the assignment of the lambda expression to an identifier. When the assignment is on its own, the outer parentheses must be ignored but when it comes to application of (LC LC), the parentheses are completely wrong as the recursive function is not right on its own and the addition of another layer makes it so that some modification is needed befoer python will recognize the code.
